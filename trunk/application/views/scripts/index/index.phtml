<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><font size="7">What we do in Taekwondo</font></h2>

<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Kicking Techniques</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">In Taekwondo we have many kicking techniques for you to learn. 90% of Sparring is using stepping and kicking techniques to score points. The kicks we perform in Taekwondo are extremely powerful &amp; should not be practiced outside of the lessons unless you are with an adult.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Hand Techniques</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Taekwondo is not all just kicking. Taekwondo has a large number of hand techniques, blocks, strikes, punches. You need to learn different techniques &amp; stances for each grading &amp; all these will help you on your journey in Taekwondo.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><font size="4"><u>Patterns (PoomSae)</u></font></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Patterns or "Poomsae" are a specific set of movements of attack and defense against an imaginary opponent. These movements are a way to implement the Hand Techniques and stances you have learnt along the way and are an opportunity to merge all you have learnt into one set or pattern.</div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Fitness Training</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Taekwondo requires a certain amount of physical fitness. We build on the fitness level you have already &amp; improve it week by week using sets of exercises to improve specific areas to help improve your Taekwondo skills. Don't worry if you don't feel fit enough to do Taekwondo, almost anyone can do it!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Sparring &amp; Stepping</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Sparring is the one thing a lot of people begin to learn Taekwondo for. Sparring is now an Olympic Sport for WTF Taekwondo is a really exhilarating experience. Sparring is a fast pace fight in a 10m x 10m ring and consists of 2 or 3 rounds. Points are scored by kicking your opponents body or head, its a really fun way to keep fit &amp; is harder than it looks.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Self Defense</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Self defence in Taekwondo is pre-arranged. The reason we practice pre-arranged self-defence is to ensure students understand the reason why they learn the movements they do &amp; how the application of the techniques they learn actually work. As students progress through Taekwondo &amp; obtain a higher grade they are then introduced to street self-defence which is unarranged &amp; are expected to put the techniques and movements they have learned into practice themselves.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span></div>

</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Confidence Building</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">From stating your name in your grading to demonstrating a technique alone in front of the whole class - these are the stepping stones to building a child's self-confidence. At C W Taekwondo we try to praise good behavior, good techniques &amp; positive attitudes.&nbsp;<br>Self confidence is important &amp; we try and build on it each &amp; every lesson.<br>With structured criticism anyone can improve their skills &amp; fitness.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Improve Flexibility</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Taekwondo is heavily based on kicking techniques flexibility is really important. We do a warm up &amp; stretching session at the start of every single lesson. With time we will have you touching your toes and working towards doing the splits.<br>Why do we need to be flexible?<br>Easy, with flexible muscles in our legs we can kick higher, are more powerfully &amp; have less risk to injury.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:center;"><u>Co-ordination</u></h2>
        <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Many of our warm up exercises will involve hand and foot co-ordination. The reason we introduce this from the beginning of the journey is to prepare the students bodies to perform actions they do not usually do on a daily basis. Some of the blocking and kicking techniques involve many movements at the same time and can take some time to master. As with everything practice makes perfect!</div>
